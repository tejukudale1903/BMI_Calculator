            Fresh, frozen, or canned fruits are great choices. Try fruits beyond
            apples and bananas such as mango, pineapple or kiwi fruit. When
            fresh fruit is not in season, try a frozen, canned, or dried
            variety. Be aware that dried and canned fruit may contain added
            sugars or syrups. Choose canned varieties of fruit packed in water
            or in its own juice.

            If your favorite recipe calls for frying fish or breaded chicken,
            try healthier variations by baking or grilling. Maybe even try dry
            beans in place of meats. Ask friends and search the internet and
            magazines for recipes with fewer calories â€• you might be surprised
            to find you have a new favorite dish!.
